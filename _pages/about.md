Welcome to Sean's homepage!

I am currently a Research Assistant at the Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong(CityUHK)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Heqing HUANG](https://5hadowblad3.github.io/).

My research interest lies in **System Security**, with a focus on **_Linux Kernel Fuzzing_** recently. 
I have participated in several projects, including an LLM-Driven Kernel Fuzzing Framework[Sneakoscope], and Storage-Efficient Kernel Fuzzer Optimization[Remembrall]. 
, my research specifically lie on mitigating software/hardware security threats using Trusted Experiment Environment(TEE),
which include distributed confidential computing[TDSC’24a, ICICS’24, GLOBECOM’20, Patent’23ab],
hardware vulnerability mitigation[USENIX’24, TDSC24’b, Exocist]. 

I aim to contribute to **building secure Operating Systems** through fundamental research with demonstrated expertise in _kernel-level system development_ and _vulnerability pattern discovery_. My research proposal on [Kernel Fuzzing] hardening and [LLM-Driven Fuzzing tool] analysis demonstrate this commitment.

**Actively pursuing Ph.D. positions in System Security. Here is my CV.**



### **NEWS!**
 * Our paper on optimizing fuzzing with fine-grained scheduling feedback is accepted in [TOSEM](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem)! 
 * Entering the finale of [DARPA AIxCC](https://aicyberchallenge.com)! All you need is a fuzzing brain!
 * Our work on fuzzing Android applications is accepted at [TSE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=32)!

## Bio
I am a true idealist, driven by intellectual curiosity and a passion for tackling unsolved challenges. Before joined CityUHK, I dedicated two years to exploring _what I want to be_ and _what I benefit to do_ in this society through diverse experiences across academia and industry. During these two years, I had the privilege to work at renowned institutions including [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en), [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), and [Huawei 2012Lab](https://www.huawei.com/cn/). I am deeply honored to have collaborated with exceptional mentors such as [Prof. Yinqian ZHANG](https://yinqian.org/), [Dr. Haoyu MA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9csJTTcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Dr. Jianyu NIU](https://jianyu-niu.github.io/), whose guidance has been pivotal to my growth. This transformative journey has not only gifted me with invaluable professional insights but also cherished memories that continue to shape my path.
