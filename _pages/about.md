Welcome to Sean's homepage!

I am currently a Research Assistant at the Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong(CityUHK)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Heqing HUANG](https://5hadowblad3.github.io/).

My research interest lies in System Security, with a focus on _Linux Kernel Fuzzing_ recently. 
I have participated in several projects, including an LLM-Driven Kernel Fuzzing Framework, and Storage-Efficient Kernel Fuzzer Optimization. 
Previously, my research specifically lie on mitigating software/hardware security threats using Trusted Experiment Environment(TEE),
which include distributed confidential computing(TDSC'24a, ICICS'24, GLOBECOM'20, Patent'23ab),
hardware vulnerability mitigation(USENIX Security'24, TDSC'24b, Exocist). 

I aim to build secure Operating Systems through fundamental research with demonstrated expertise in _kernel-level system development_ and _vulnerability pattern discovery_. My research proposal on *Kernel Fuzzing* hardening and *LLM-Driven Fuzzing* tool analysis demonstrate this commitment.

**Actively pursuing Ph.D. positions in System Security. Here is my [CV](/files/%5B250409%5DCV_Xiang_Li.pdf).**

## Bio
I am a true idealist, driven by intellectual curiosity and a passion for tackling unsolved challenges. Before joined CityUHK, I dedicated two years to exploring _what I want to be_ and _what I benefit to do_ in this society through diverse experiences across academia and industry. During these two years, I had the privilege to work at renowned institutions including [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en), [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), and [Huawei 2012Lab](https://www.huawei.com/cn/). I am deeply honored to have collaborated with exceptional mentors such as [Prof. Yinqian ZHANG](https://yinqian.org/), [Dr. Haoyu MA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9csJTTcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Dr. Jianyu NIU](https://jianyu-niu.github.io/), whose guidance has been pivotal to my growth. This transformative journey has not only gifted me with invaluable professional insights but also cherished memories that continue to shape my path.

## About me
I was born in Shandong, China. I am obsessed with playing musicüé∂, such as accordionü™ó and pianoüéπ. Also, you would often see me at livehousesüé§ and talk-showsü§£. These hobbies shaped my sentimental personalities. Talk is cheap, show me your activities! I love express myself and experiencing new things.
