Welcome to Sean Xiang LI's homepage!

I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Heqing HUANG](https://5hadowblad3.github.io/). Previously, I dedicated two years to exploring _what I want to be_ and _what I benefit to do_ in this society through diverse experiences across academia and industry. During these two years, I had the privilege to work at renowned institutions including [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en), [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), and [Huawei 2012Lab](https://www.huawei.com/cn/). I am deeply honored to have collaborated with exceptional mentors such as [Prof. Yinqian ZHANG](https://yinqian.org/), [Dr. Haoyu MA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9csJTTcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Dr. Jianyu NIU](https://jianyu-niu.github.io/), whose guidance has been pivotal to my growth. This transformative journey has not only gifted me with invaluable professional insights but also cherished memories that continue to shape my path.

I aim to develop secure and reliable systems that protect users from vulnerabilities using Large Language Models. 
My research interest lies in System Security, with a focus on Linux Kernel Fuzzing recently. 
I have participated in several projects, including an LLM-Driven Kernel Fuzzing Framework(Sneakoscope), and Storage-Efficient Kernel Fuzzer Optimization(Remembrall). 
Before joined CityUHK, my research specifically lie on mitigating software/hardware security threats using Trusted Experiment Environment(TEE),
which include distributed confidential computing(TDSC’24a, ICICS’24, GLOBECOM’20, Patent’23ab),
hardware vulnerability mitigation(USENIX’24, TDSC24’b, Exocist).
